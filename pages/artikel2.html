      <h1>-- Mental Health --</h1>

      <p>
        Mental health is crucial for our well-being. By prioritizing self-care and awareness, we can foster a positive mental attitude. Regular mindfulness, breathing exercises, and adequate sleep are fundamental aspects of stress management. Openly discussing with friends or professionals can create a supportive environment. Setting goals, even small ones, and caring for oneself are key to establishing a strong foundation for mental health. Recognizing one's limits and taking breaks when needed is also important. By integrating these practical strategies, we can strengthen our mental health and maintain a balanced lifestyle.
